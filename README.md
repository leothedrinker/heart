# heart
Ascii art of a heart

This project is written to my wife as a Christmas gift :)

Inspired by [https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html)

Unecessarily used some C++ 20 feature (non-type template parameters of deduced class type). To compile, use
```
g++ -std=c++20 -o heart heart.cpp
```
